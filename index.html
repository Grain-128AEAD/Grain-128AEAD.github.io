<h1>Grain-128AEAD</h1>

<p>Grain-128AEAD is a stream cipher supporting authenticated encryption with associated data. It is currently one of the ciphers in the NIST lightweight crypto standardization process.</p>

<p>Here, we collect material related to the cipher, including design documents, hardware and software implementations, and analysis results. If you are aware of documents or results that should be shown here, please let us know through hirotaka.yoshida@@aist.go.jp or martin.hell@eit.lth.se. We'd be happy to link to any third party material.</p>

<p>Grain-128AEAD is a member of the Grain family of stream ciphers. Many of the other variants in the family have undergone much analysis. Those results, while sometimes also valid for Grain-128AEAD, will not be featured on this website. However, the design document includes several references to these for anyone interested.</p>

This paper presents the core design of Grain-128AEAD. Note that it does not follow the NIST API as it does not e.g., explicitly handle variable length associated data.</li>

This is the official round 2 specification of the design (on NISTs website). Note that it is identical to the round 1 specification.</li>

This paper presents a hardware implementation (VHDL) in 65nm technology. Synthesis and power simulations is done using the Synopsys Design Compiler 2013.12. The implementation can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/Grain-128AEAD">Grain-128AEAD repo</a> on Github.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Software implementation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The reference software implementation can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/Grain-128AEAD">Grain-128AEAD repo</a> on Github. The reference implementation is also available on <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/lightweight-cryptography/round-2-candidates">NISTs round 2 website</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Analysis</h3>
We do not know of any explicit analysis of Grain-128AEAD. However, the design is similar to Grain-128a and some analysis on that cipher can be found in the design document.
